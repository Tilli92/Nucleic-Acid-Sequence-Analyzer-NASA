Hi all,

This was my first python coding project. It simply uses the Regex search algorithm to identifiy patterns in a nucleic acid sequence (Nucleic-Acid-Sequnece-Analyzer = NASA).

I simply made a GUI to allow people which are not familiar with the use of terminals/consols to use the algorithm.

You can provide a nucleic acid sequence and search for patterns like transcription factor binding sites or others.

Have fun using it :)!
